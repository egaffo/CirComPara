'''
The purpose of this script is to rename FASTQ reads.
Current implementation eliminates trailing '.1's and '.2's (or '/1's '/2's) from the read
names.
This comes useful when paired-end read files are named with .1 .2 notation to distinguish 
mates, but programs raise errors because the names are different and read pairs are not
recognized as such.
